<!--Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your websiteâ€™s SEO.
<header>, <nav> , <main> and <footer> create the basic structure of the webpage.
<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
<article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
<aside> contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
<figure> encapsulates all types of media.
<figcaption> is used to describe the media in <figure>.
<video>, <embed>, and <audio> elements are used for media files.-->
