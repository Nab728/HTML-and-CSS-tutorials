<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!--^ should be in the top of every html file.-->
<head>
    <title>My tutorial</title>
</head>
<p>
head is next and it includes the metadata of the website<br>
There is also an achor attribute known as a which you can add a href attribute which allows a link
and text for the link.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">This is a link to youtube</a><br>
There is also a target attribute which specifies how a link should be open.<br>

<b>One such target attribute is the target="_blank" attribute</b> which makes it so a new tab 
is opened. Not really a difference as this attribute is already set on default<br>
</p>
Also you can link webpages in the same folder together doing:
<a href="./index.html">Other Web Page</a><br>
Also ./ should be in front of another webpage name as it tells to program to search for the other 
webpage inside the folder. Don't use it if the link is to a 3rd party website.<br>
<!-- Oh yea these are how you make comments in html-->
<!-- You can also link a link to a photo -->
<!-- last few pages of the course talked about white space and indention in order to make 
your code more readable-->
<!--White space means each piece of code should take one line-->

    <h1></h1>

<!--The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.-->
</html>
