    <h1>Remember to do !tab for the basic setup</h1>
    <div>
        <p style="color:darkblue;"><b>Use div to seperate divide the topics</b></p>
        <p>p for small paragraphs and span idk <span>dj</span>
        </p>
        <p>Also line breaks like this.<br> Yes.
        </p>
        <p>also the heading number relates to the size of the letters in a heading
        </p>
        <small>HEY IM SMALL</small>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>There are also unorganized list known as ul which creates a list with bullet points and needs a li after it.<br> kinda like this
           <ul>
               <li><a href="#visuals now">Visuals Now</a></li>
               <li><a href="#videos">Videos</a></li>
               <li><a href="#youtube">Youtube</a></li>
            </ul> 
          <!-- make sure the id matches the anchor your anchoring to the list and also the id is case sensitive-->
        <p>
            Now to ordered lists: each element has a number next to it unlike an unorganized list
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>dog</li>
            <li>cat</li>
            <li>fish</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
        <h1>Visuals Now</h1>
    <div id="visuals now">
        <!-- look at id-->
        <p>
           <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney" target="_blank">
            <img src='c.jpg' width='320' height="240"  /> Most images need to be in the same folder location as the html file</a>
            <!--Img doesn't need a closing tag-->
            <br><br>
            Now there is the alt attribute which is like a caption to a photo for visually impaired users and if there's no photo
            <br>
            <img src="CT_PCver_1680_1050.jpg" alt='Failed image rip' /><br><br>
        </p>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
            <p>
            Also you can put videos into the website too and unlike the img tag it needs an opening and closing tag<br>
            <video src='https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4'
            width='320' height='240' controls>
            Video is not supported
            </video><br>
            The sentence 'video is not supported' is when the video cannot load and also controls is so that
            the video has basic features like pause,play,skip. And the measurements should be self explanatory.<br><br>
            <p>
    </div> 
         
    <div>
         <h1 id="youtube">Youtube</h1>
             <p>
            <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Bvp75M0ezY?autoplay=1&loop=1&mute=1"></iframe>
            </iframe><br><br>
            An iframe is basically it's a section of your webpage looking at another piece of another content you
            want to embededd and to display 3rd party content. Make sure to use the link https://www.youtube.com/embed
            and the id code.<br><br>
            Add ?autoplay=1&mute=1 if you want the video to autoplay but be muted.<br>
            You can also add loop=1 to loop forever and controls=0 to make the regular player controls to disappear and the controls are set to 1 by default.<br>
            </p>

<!--HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.
Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.-->
